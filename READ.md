# AI Pizza Ontology

## Project Overview
This project creates a simple ontology for pizzas using Protege. It represents different pizza bases and toppings, organized hierarchically. The ontology can be used for reasoning about pizza types and querying their components.

## Features
- **Class Hierarchy**: Pizzas, bases (e.g., thin crust), and toppings (e.g., mozzarella).
- **Reasoning Support**: Use Protege reasoners to classify and infer relationships.
- **Applications**: Query for pizzas with specific toppings or bases.

## Folder Structure
- `ontology/`: Contains the main RDF file for the pizza ontology.
- `images/`: Includes screenshots showing class hierarchy and ontology reasoning.
- `report/`: Contains a detailed project report.

## Tools Used
- **Protege**: For ontology creation and reasoning.
- **RDF/XML**: To store ontology data.
